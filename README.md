# Airline-Data-Warehouse-project-
Create a Data Warehouse model to answer some business questions for Airline company .

In this project, we aim to analyze the flight activities of an airline company and its frequent flyers. The goal is to create a data warehouse schema to store historical data and answer various business questions.

The airline company wants to improve its understanding of flight activities and ensure efficient business processes. The marketing department is particularly interested in analyzing the flights taken by frequent flyers, their fare basis, upgrade frequency, frequent flyer miles earning and redemption patterns, response to special fare promotions, duration of overnight stays, and the distribution of gold, platinum, or titanium status among frequent flyers.

We also need to analyze the reservation process, as the finance team wants to assess the company's profitability. It's important to consider that reservations can occur through multiple channels.

Additionally, the airline company provides customer care interaction to address inquiries, complaints, and gather feedback for business enhancements. The analysis should include the type of interactions and the severity of any issues encountered.

To begin the project, we'll identify and document the key processes for the airline company. Then, we'll employ modeling techniques, such as dimensional modeling, along with a demonstrative layering methodology. This approach will help us design the logical and physical structures necessary to support the analysis and decision-making process.

By undertaking this project, we can gain valuable insights into the airline company's flight activities, frequent flyer behavior, reservation process, and customer interactions. These insights will enable the company to optimize operations, identify new opportunities, and enhance overall business performance.
